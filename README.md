Maybe someday I'll actually get to build this!

This is a Quasi Continuous Wave Doubly Resonant Solid State Tesla Coil, with one twist. I'm trying my best to not compromise on any part of this build. 
For reasons that I do not care to share, I have a few years before I can even fathom being able to buy the parts for any tesla coil, but I do have the means
to design one. So, why not go all out? 

Basic informations:
TRIPLE full bridge consisting of IXXH150N60C3 IGBTs
CM600 IGBT module buck converter
ICE40LP384-SG32 FPGA Driver logic
Raspberry Pi Pico control and data collection for human analysis
3 selectable methods of gate drive isolation: Optical, Inductive, and Capacitive.
4 selectable MMCs, each of different characteristics: Cylindrical Mica (Unobtanium for the most part), Large sufrace mount C0G (Aluminum PCB = heat 
dissapation = higher RMS current), Traditional High RMS current film, and ceramic ebay doorknob capacitors
      Note: The ceramic doorknob capacitors don't typically come with the same capacitance rating as the other MMCs (each of which are 8.2nF), so if you want 
      to try using both, you'll also need a modular primary coil
